I attemped to add motivational stats to the keyboard trainer. I requested a high score be tracked and displayed as well as a list of frequently mistyped letters. I have a feeling ChatGPT would be able to add at least the high score, but I also asked for a chart to track the progress of WPM over time. I think this is a reasonable feature as the WPM is updated as the user is typing and it should be possible to save each unqiue WPM and display with the seconds spent typing. Typing test websites like MonkeyType display a chart like this after each test. I imagined the chart would be displayed with the results screen, calculated as described above. It would show the peaks of typing speed achieved during each test. The high score and frequently missed letters would always be visible. ChatGPT failed to implement these features as the entire updating WPM and final results screen stopped working with each attempt at adding these new features. While I got more specific with each prompt, I didn't see any changes being made and the website lost all functionality.
